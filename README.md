file cleaning_and_exploratory_and_explanatory_visualizations shows a thorough cleaning of the dataset for visualization purposes. It then shows scatterplots, histograms, boxplots, barplots, and a heatmap for exploratory visualization. For explanatory visualization, I propose several questions and answer with various types of plots. 

file preprocessing_for_machine_learning takes a fresh (uncleaned) copy of the dataset and prepares it for machine learning with several steps, including splitting the data into training and testing sets, encoding ordinal values, scaling numeric values, one hot encoding categorical values, and creating a preprocessing object with pipelines.
